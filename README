An online 2-player hangman utilizing raphael.js and comet.

The game is built on long polling as opposed to websockets due to contemporary
browsers' lack of support for websockets. The backend is built on python and
mongodb is used for persistance.

The current tech stack consists of:

* JQuery and Raphael.js
* Nginx compiled with the http push module
* Python with the Flask and pymongo modules
* MongoDB

I haven't bundled any dependencies as of now. What you need to get this running
is nginx compiled with the http push module. To avoid cross domain xhr, you need
to make your nginx server act as reverse proxy. This means that the same host 
receives all the requests on the same port (regardsless of whether they'll hang 
on the server or not). Nginx will dispatch the requests to the correct endpoints 
based on configuration values. Nginx is very good at this and it is almost 
trivial to configure.
